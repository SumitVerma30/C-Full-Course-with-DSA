MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE:-
Multilevel Inheritance in C++ is the process of deriving a class from another derived class. When one class inherits another class it is further inherited by another class. It is known as multi-level inheritance.

    SYNTAX:

class A // base class
{
    ...........
};
class B : access_specifier A // derived class
{
    ...........
} ;
class C : access_specifier B // derived from derived class B
{
    ...........
} ;

    KEY PPOINTS:
Access Specifiers: Ensure appropriate access specifiers (public, protected, private) are used during inheritance to control visibility.
Method Overriding: Derived classes can override base class methods to provide specific behavior.
Constructor Calling: Constructors are called in the order of inheritance (from the base class to the most derived class).
Destructors: Destructors are called in the reverse order (from the most derived class to the base class).
