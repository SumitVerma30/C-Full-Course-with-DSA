SINGLE INHERITANCE:-
In single inheritance, a derived class(Child class) inherits the properties/behaviour of a single base class (Praent class).

Syntax:-
class base_class_name {
    // properties and methods
    //body....
};
class derived_class_name : public base_class_name {
    // body....
};

    ADVANTAGES OF SINGLE INHERITANCE:-
-> Code Reusability:- Allows reusing the functionality of the base class.
-> Simplified Code:- Reduces redundancy and improves maintainability.
-> Extensibility:- Derived classes can extend the functionality of the base class.

    KEY NOTES:-
1. Constructors and Destructors:
    -> The base class constructor is called before the derived class constructor.
    -> The derived class destructor is called before the base class destructor
2. Access Control: Use appropriate access specifiers to control what members of the base class are accessible in the derived class.
