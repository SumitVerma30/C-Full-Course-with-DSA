CONSTRUCTORS:-
A constructor in C++ is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.
The constructor in C++ has the same name as the class or structure. It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object which is why it is known as a constructor.

Syntax:-
class-name (){
    //body of object
}

    Characteristics of Constructors in C++:-
-> The name of the constructor is the same as its class name.
-> Constructors are mostly declared in the public section of the class though they can be declared in the private section of the class.
-> Constructors do not return values; hence they do not have a return type.
-> A constructor gets called automatically when we create the object of the class.
