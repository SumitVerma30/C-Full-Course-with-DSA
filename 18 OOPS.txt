OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOPs):-
-> OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
-> Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming.
-> Focuses on Data.
-> Works ont he concept of classes and objects.
-> A class is a template to create objects.
-> Treats data as a critical element.
-> Break the problems in objects.

    BASIC CONCEPTS IN OOP:-
-> Classes - Basic template for creating objects.
-> Objects - Basic run time entities.
-> Data Abstraction & Encapsulation - Wrapping data and functions into single unit.
-> Inheritance - Properties of one class can be inherited into others.
-> Polymorphism - ability to take more than one forms.
-> Dynamic Binding - code which will execute is not known until the program. runs.
-> Message Passing - Object.message (Information) call format.


PROCEDURE ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (POP):-
-> Consists of writing a set of instructions for the computer to follow.
-> Main focus is on functions and not on flow of data.
-> Function can either use local or global data.
-> Data moves openly from function to functions.


    BENEFITS OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING:-
-> Better code reusability using objects and inheritance.
-> Principle of hiding helps build secure systems.
-> Multiple objects can co-exist without any interface.
-> Software complexity can be esaily managed.
