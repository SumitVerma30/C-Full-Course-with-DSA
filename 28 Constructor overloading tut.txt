CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING:-
In C++ is a feature that allows a class to have multiple constructors with the same name but different parameter lists. This provides flexibility in initializing objects of a class in various ways.

    KEY POINTS:-
-> Same Name:- All constructors share the same name as the class.
-> Different Signatures:- Constructors must differ in their parameter lists (type, number, or order of parameters).
-> Purpose:- To allow objects to be initialized in multiple ways based on different scenarios.

Syntax:-
class class-name {
public:
    // Default constructor
    class-name() {}             // No parameter

    // Parameterized constructor (1 parameter)
    class-name(parameter 1) {}

    // Parameterized constructor (2 parameters)
    class-name(parameter 1, parameter2) {}

};

    BENEFITS:-
-> Code Readability: Makes the code cleaner and more intuitive.
-> Flexibility: Allows initialization of objects in different ways.
-> Convenience: Reduces the need for setter methods for initial values.

    NOTES:-
-> If no constructor is explicitly defined, C++ provides a default constructor.
-> Overloaded constructors can call one another using the this pointer or by explicitly calling another constructor from within the constructor body.
