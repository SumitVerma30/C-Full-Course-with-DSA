FRIEND FUNCTION:-
In C++, a friend function is a function that is not a member of a class but is allowed to access the class's private and protected members. By using the friend keyword, a class can grant specific functions (or entire classes) access to its private and protected members, which would otherwise be inaccessible from outside the class.

    Characteristics of Friend Functions:-
-> Not a Member Function: Friend functions are not part of the class they are declared in.
-> Access to Private and Protected Members: They can access all private and protected members of the class that declares them as a friend.
-> Declared Inside the Class: The friend function must be declared inside the class it is given access to, using the friend keyword, but it is defined outside the class.
-> Not Called with an Object: Unlike member functions, friend functions do not need to be called with an object of the class.

Syntax of Friend Functions:-
To declare a friend function, use the friend keyword in the class definition:-

class ClassName {
    private:
        int data;
    
    public:
        ClassName(int value) : data(value) {}
        
        // Declare a friend function
        friend void showData(ClassName obj);
};

PROPERTIES OF FRIEND FUNCTION:-
1. Not in the scope of class.
2. Since it is not in scope of class, it cannot be called from the objects of that class.
3. Can be invoked without the help of any object.
4. Usually contains the objects as arguments.
5. Can be declared inside public or peivate section of the class.
