For Input and Output in C++, we use the following libraries:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

//Input:
In C++ "cin" is used to take input from the user followed by extraction operator(>>).
Syntax:
cin>>variable_name;

Example:
int a;
cin>>a;
cout<<a;

//Output:
In C++ "cout" is used to print output to the user followed by insertion operator(<<).
Syntax:
cout<<variable_name;

Example:
int a;
cin>>a;
cout<<a;

//endl:
endl is used to print a new line.
Syntax:
cout<<endl;

Example:
cout<<"Hello World"<<endl;

// \n:
\n is also used to print a new line.
Syntax:
cout<<'\n';

Example:
cout<<"Hello World \n";

// \t:
\t is used to print a tab space.
Syntax:
cout<<'\t';

Example:
cout<<"Hello World \t";
