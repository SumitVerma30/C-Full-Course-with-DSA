Functions:-
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. 
-> The idea is to put repeatedly done tasks together to make a function, so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call this function any time in the code.

Syntax:-
return-type func_name (){
    // body of the function
}

Calling a Function:-
Function is called in program by using function name as:

func_name ();

Parameters and arguments:-
The values assigned to the function is known as its Parameters.
-> Parameters are written in open Braces ().

type functionName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}

Default Parameters:-
Parameters whose value is assigned while declaring parameters are known as default parameters.
OR Parameters with some value assigned during declaration are known as default parameters.

type functionName(parameter1, parameter2 = "value"){            //parameter2 is a default parameter
    // Body of function
}     

Function Prototype:-
If we want to define function after function declaration or main function, then function prototype is used.
syntax:-
type function-name (arguments);
