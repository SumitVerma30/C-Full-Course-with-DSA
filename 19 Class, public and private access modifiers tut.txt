CLASSES:-
A class is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object.

-> For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range, etc. So here, the Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, and mileage are their properties.

Syntax:-
A class is defined in C++ using the keyword class followed by the name of the class. The following is the syntax:

class ClassName {
     access_specifier:
     // Body of the class
};

ACCESS SPECIFIERS:-
Access modifiers are used to implement an important aspect of Object-Oriented Programming known as Data Hiding.

In C++, there are three access specifiers:

-> public - members are accessible from outside the class
-> private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
-> protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes. You will learn more about Inheritance later.
