MULTIPLE INHERITANCE:-
In C++, multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit from more than one base class.
-> However, it introduces complexities such as ambiguity and the diamond problem. (DISCUSSED IN NEXT LECTURES).

SYNTAX:-
class Base1 {
    // Base1 members
};

class Base2 {
    // Base2 members
};

class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
    // Derived members
};

Key Concepts
1. Ambiguity When two base classes have members with the same name, the derived class must explicitly specify which base class member to use.
2. The Diamond Problem When a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class, ambiguity can arise. This is known as the diamond problem.

ADVANTAGES:-
1. Enables complex relationships.
2. Allows code reuse from multiple base classes.

DISADVANTAGES:-
1. Can lead to ambiguity and complexity.
2. Difficult to debug in large systems.
3. The diamond problem adds further complications.
4. Multiple inheritance should be used cautiously and only when it adds significant value to your design.
